/**
 * A "chirp" or frequency sweep is a sine wave with in time increasing frequency, and can be
 * used for system identification purposes. Using the output of the chirp function
 * as input to the system allows registering the system behavior over a broad frequency
 * spectrum.
 *
 * Chirps can be made with frequency increasing linearly or exponentially with time. This is set using an argument in
 * the chirp_new method. The latter one is better for system identification, according to [2].
 *
 * The time length of the chirp is best put at a minimum of 4 / f_minimum such that low-frequency effects
 * can be correctly discovered.
 *
 * The fade_in argument determines if the chirp fades in with increasing amplitude at
 * constant frequency (the lowest frequency). This makes it much easier to maintain the UAV around the trim position.
 * However, it takes up a fair amount of the total chirp time, so adjust your length_s accordingly!
 *
 * Usage example:
 * // Initialize a chirp between 1 and 5 Hz during 2 seconds (for sys. id. use minimum of 2 * 1/f0)
 * struct chirpt_t* chirp = chirp_new(1, 5, 2, get_current_time());
 *
 * // During flight loop, add chirp value to stick input
 * while (chirp_is_running(chirp, get_current_time())) {
 *     control[YAW] = stick_control + chirp_update(chirp, get_current_time());
 * }
 *
 * // Delete chirp object
 * chirp_del(chirp);
